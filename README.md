# Neovim Config

This config is mostly to handle full-stack development with JS/TS and Java/Spring-boot. There are probably still issues somewhere, and it is always a WIP. One feature I'd like to mention, is following the comment for sessions in the `autocommands.lua` file will set you up with sessions per Git repository. 

## Credits
- [Thomas Stringer](https://trstringer.com/neovim-automatic-session-git-branch-aware/) for initial sessions config.
- [elmcgill](https://github.com/elmcgill) for the initial Java setup.

## Dependencies
- Neovim >= 0.10
- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) > 0.27
